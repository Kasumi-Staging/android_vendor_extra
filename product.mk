# STOP!

# You were NOT supposed to look into here!
#
# The configuration you're looking for is in config.mk!
# And a SYMLINK of config.mk is made in vendor/kasumi directory in
# build root using local_manifests!
#
# This Makefile is just A DECOY to include the symlinked config!
#
# You're in the wrong file! I swear! Just go in config.mk if you want
# actual Makefile code in action!
